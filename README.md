<strong>    
GraphQL is an open-source query language and runtime for application programming interfaces (APIs) that uses HTTP to build development architectures. It allows developers to ask for specific data from multiple sources and return it using a defined structure. GraphQL is similar to REST and SOAP, but it can be a good alternative in some cases, such as for mobile applications.
